# Fake Sneaker Website – Phishing Awareness Demo 

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **phishing awareness demonstration** created for **educational and cybersecurity training purposes**.

It simulates how a **normal-looking phishing website combined with basic social engineering techniques** can trick users into granting sensitive permissions — in this case, **camera access**.

The website is designed as a **fake sneaker discount platform** that appears harmless and visually appealing, similar to many real-world scam websites.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project

The main objective of this project is to **educate audiences** (students, employees, and the general public) on:

- How phishing websites look legitimate  
- How social engineering manipulates user trust  
- How permissions like **camera access** can be misused  
- Why blindly clicking *“Allow”* can have serious privacy consequences  

This project is commonly used in:
- Cybersecurity awareness sessions  
- Ethical hacking demonstrations  
- Social engineering workshops

## 🧠 How the Social Engineering Works

1. The website offers a **discount** to users.
2. Users are prompted to **take a picture of their sneaker** to claim the discount.
3. The browser requests **camera access**.
4. Once allowed:
   - The **selfie camera is activated**
   - A **small live preview window** appears on the screen  

⚠️ **Important Note:**  
The camera is **NOT accessed secretly**. The preview window clearly shows that the camera is active, reinforcing transparency for educational purposes.
